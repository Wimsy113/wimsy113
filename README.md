## Don't Call Me A Unicorn

### ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/Them
I am an artist, turned coder, turned UX designer, turned coder again. I have a keen eye for design, and a knack for front end development, please don't ask me to build you an api, it's not that I can't it's that I don't want to.

When I'm not adding to my contributions on Github, I'm drawing, 3D printing stuff and playing games with my friends. I also stream live on Twitch too!
